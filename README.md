# Maze Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive HTML5 application to visualize and compare 2D maze pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS) with animation, manual editing, weights, and statistics.

## Features
- Visualize A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS algorithms
- Step-by-step animation and speed control
- Manual wall, start, end, and weight editing
- Diagonal movement toggle
- Algorithm comparison with stats
- Replay and statistics panel

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. All logic is in `main.js`.
